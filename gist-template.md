# Title (replace with your title)

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching in strings. In this tutorial, we'll delve into a JavaScript regex pattern designed to validate email addresses. We'll break down each component of the regex, explaining the purpose and usage of anchors, quantifiers, character classes, and more.

## Summary

The regex pattern we'll be exploring is /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. This pattern is crafted to validate email addresses, ensuring they adhere to a specific structure. We'll discuss each aspect of the regex, including anchors for string boundaries, character classes to define valid characters, and capturing groups to extract different parts of the email.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The Anchors ^ and $ ensure that the regex matches from the start ^ to the end $ of the string. In our pattern, they define the beginning and end of the email.

### Quantifiers

The Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or group. In our regex, + requires at least one occurrence of the specified characters

### OR Operator

There isn't a direct use of the OR operator (|) in this pattern, but character classes serve a similar purpose by allowing multiple valid characters in a specific position.

### Character Classes

Character classes ([...]) define sets of characters that are allowed in a particular position. The pattern uses character classes to ensure the local and domain parts of the email contain valid characters.

### Flags

No flags are used in this regex, but the i flag could be added after the closing / to make the matching case-insensitive.

### Grouping and Capturing

Parentheses () create capturing groups. In our pattern, they are used to capture the local part, domain part, and top-level domain (TLD) separately.

### Bracket Expressions

The Bracket expressions ([a-z], [\d]) match a single character from the specified range. They are used to define valid characters for different parts of the email.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

The pattern uses greedy matching by default. To make quantifiers lazy, use +? and *?.

### Boundaries

No specific boundaries (\b) are used in this pattern, as the anchors handle the string boundaries.

### Back-references

There are no back-references in this regex.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

No look-ahead or look-behind assertions are used in this pattern.
